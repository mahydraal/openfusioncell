this is a directory to contain mechanical design files for the generation 2 anvil cell. 
the anvils used in this cell can be found at these locations:

the cell is held together by #12 machine bolts and associated nuts.
a 1/4-20 set will work as well but require some redrilling. You would do well to use washers in on both sides in either case.

the electrical terminals on either end use the same bolts as the drive bolts that clamp the cell together.

Highly recommended that you print this anvil cell at 100% infill to maximize functional strength of the components.
The maximum practical working pressure of this assembly is ~25 GPa at best. I have only tested it to ~10 GPa.

Changes on the horizon:
change the holes on the frame to faciliate washers natively and provide more support.
add stress relief fillets to the sharp eges near the bolt holes.
find/make shorter anvils of the same culet diameter or smaller

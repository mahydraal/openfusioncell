this is a directory for storing images of compressed samples in the open fusion cell project. 

the images herein containing a blue blob surrounded by orange/yellow, are images of an initial test using Isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol 99%) at a pressure exceeding 1 GPa. 
At such pressure in this generation two anvil cell (made of 3D printed PLA and two hardedend stainless steel coin folding anvils) the IPA converts to a metastable amorphous ice.

the blue stuff is the amorphous ice. the yellow/orange stuff is a kapton tape gasket used to contain the sample between th anvils.
